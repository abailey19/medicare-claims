# Processing Medicare claims

## The Project
My freshman winter and spring (January-June 2019), I worked as a research intern with Dr. Inas Khayal at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice.
I worked to learn the structure of a Medicare claim and wrote code to pull and organize relevant data from a claim. This code has been used to accelerate and organize Dr. Khayal's research, and will eventually contribute to the back end for a web app to allow patients and doctors to access their data.

## The Code
My code parses data from patient data files, which contain basic information about patients, and from explanation of benefit files, which contain multiple Medicare claims. It extracts data that Dr. Khayal and I deemed relevant, such as treatment, diagnosis, providers, location, and cost. It puts this data into a Pandas dataframe, which I am currently writing to an Excel file for easy readability.
